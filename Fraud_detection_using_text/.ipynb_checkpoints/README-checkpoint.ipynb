    "### Text mining techniques for fraud detection\n",
    "- When using text data in fraud analysis, there are multiple ways to use the data.\n",
    "1. **Word search** : A common application is a word search, to flag any data mentioning certain terms.\n",
    "2. **Sentiment Analysis** : measuring how positive or negative a text is can be combined with word search. We can check whether text data associated with fraud tends to be more negative or positive relative to the normal text. \n",
    "3. **Word frequencies and topic analysis** : Topic analysis and counting the frequency of certain words of interest, is another powerful application for fraud detection.\n",
    "4. **Style** : Analyze the style of text data and search for text that is similar in style to flag for fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Word search for fraud detection\n",
    "- **Flagging suspicious words** : Suppose we want to flag all client transcations that mention a certain gambling company, as this company has received bad press lately. A simple word search on all transcations and client emails can easily filter whether any of the clients mention this company.\n",
    "- We can then use this result as a filter, or a flag on its own, or simply as an additional feature in our ML model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Word counts to flag fraud with pandas\n",
    "- Pandas has functions that allow us to do operations on text data within a pandas series or dataframe. Here we use `str.contains` function to find all rows that contain the word **money laundering**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# using a string operator to find words\n",
    "df['email_body'].str.contains('money laundering')\n",
    "\n",
    "# select data the matches\n",
    "df.loc[df['email_body'].str.contains('money laundering', na=False)]\n",
    "\n",
    "# the need to use na=False is to ignore all rows containing missing values, otherwise the indexer won't work.\n",
    "\n",
    "# create a list of words to search for\n",
    "list_of_words = ['police', 'money laundering']\n",
    "df.loc[df['email_body'].str.contains('|'.join(list_of_words), na=False)] \n",
    "\n",
    "# we need to join the list of words with the \"or\" command \n",
    "\n",
    "# create a fraud flag\n",
    "df['flag'] = np.where((df['email_body'].str.contains('|'.join(list_of_words)) == True), 1 ,0)\n",

    "#### Cleaning our text data\n",
    "- Whenever we work with text data, be it for word search, topic modelling, sentiment analysis or text style, we need to do some rigorous text cleaning in order to be able to work with the data.\n",
    "- Must do's when working with textual data\n",
    "1. **Tokenization** and lowercase with puncutation removing\n",
    "2. Remove all **stopwords** as they mess up our data\n",
    "3. **Lemmatize words** : chaning words from third person into first person, changing verbs in past and future tenses into present tenses. This allows us to combine all words that points to the same thing.\n",
    "4. **Stem words** : reduce words to their root form. For e.g walking and walk\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data preprocessing part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 1. Tokenization\n",
    "from nltk import word_tokenize\n",
    "\n",
    "text = df.apply(lambda row:word_tokenize(row['email_body']), axis=1)\n",
    "text = text.rstrip()  # remove whitespaces\n",
    "text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z]', ' ', text) # lowercasing using re\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Remove all stopwords and punctutaions\n",
    "from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n",
    "import string\n",
    "\n",
    "exclude = set(string.punctuation)\n",
    "stop = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n",
    "stop_free = \" \".join([word for word in text if ((word not in stop) and (not word.isdigit()))])\n",
    "punc_free = \" \".join(word for word in stop_free if word not in exclude)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data preprocessing part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Lemmatize words\n",
    "from nltk.stem.wordnet import WordNetLemmatizer\n",
    "lemma = WordNetLemmatizer()\n",
    "normalized = \" \".join(lemma.lemmatize(word) for word in punc_free.split())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Stem words\n",
    "from nltk.stem.porter import PorterStemmer\n",
    "porter = PorterStemmer()\n",
    "cleaned_text = \" \".join(porter.stem(token) for token in normalized.split())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Topic modelling on fraud\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Topic modelling : discover hidden patterns in text data\n",
    "1. Topic modelling can be a powerful tool when searching for fraud in text data.\n",
    "2. Topic modelling allows us to **discover abstract \"topics\"** that occur in a collection of documents.\n",
    "3. Intutively, given that a document is about a particular topic, one would expect particular words to appear in the document more or less frequently.\n",
    "4. Topic modelling therefore tells us in a very efficient way **what the text is about**, based on the words it contains.\n",
    "5. **Conceptually it is similar to clustering, as it clusters words belonging to the same topic together**.\n",
    "6. If we have text data of known fraud cases, it allows us to check what are the most common topics for those fraud cases and use that to compare unknown cases. In other words, **compare topics for those fraud cases and use that to compare unknown cases**.\n",
    "7. Without known labels, we can inspect which topics seem to point to fraudulent behaviour and are interesting to further investigate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)\n",
    "1. LDA is an example of topic model and is commonly used.\n",
    "2. LDA creates a **\"topic per text item\"** model and **\"words per topic\"** model, which are called **Dirichlet distributions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating our own topic model\n",
    "1. Clean the data\n",
    "2. Then, create a dictionary containing which words appear how often in all of the text.And also a corpus, containing for each text line in our data the count of words that appear. -> **Create a bag of words** with dictionary and corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LDA\n",
    "- The results that we get from this model are two fold:\n",
    "1. First we see how each **word** in our total data is associated with each topic.\n",
    "2. Second, we can also see how each text item in our data associates with topics, also in the form of probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/LDA.JPG\" width=\"350\" title=\"LDA\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementing LDA with gensim, Bag of words : dictionary and corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from gensim import corpora\n",
    "\n",
    "# use Dictionary function in corpora to create a dictionary from a text data, in this case cleaned emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "# create dictionary of number of times a word appears\n",
    "dictionary = corpora.Dictionary(cleaned_emails)\n",
    "\n",
    "# filter out non frequent words : filter out words that appear in less than 5 emails and keep only the 50000 most frequent words, in a way of cleaning out the outlier noise of the text data.\n",
    "dictionary.filter_extremes(no_below=5, keep_n=50000)\n",
    "\n",
    "# create a corpus that tells us for each email how many words it contains and how many times those words appear\n",
    "# Doc2bow stands for \"document to bag of words\". This function converts text data into bag-of-words format. That means each row in our data is now a list of words with their associated word count.\n",
    "corpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(text) for text in cleaned_emails]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. After cleaning the text data, and creating dictionary and corpus, we are now ready to run our LDA model.\n",
    "2. We need to pass the corpus and dictionary into the LDA model.\n",
    "3. As with k-means, we need to pick the number of topics we want to obtain beforehand, even if we're not sure yet what the topics are.\n",
    "4. The LDA model calculated here, now contains the associated words for each topic, and the topic scores per email.\n",
    "5. We can obtain the top words from the three topics with the function **\"print_topics\"** \n",
    "6. After running the model, we print the 3 topics and the four top keywords associated with the topic, for interpretation of results\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import gensim\n",
    "\n",
    "# define the LDA model\n",
    "ldamodel = gensim.models.ldamodel.LdaModel(corpus, num_topics=3, id2word=dictionary, passes=15)\n",
    "\n",
    "# print the 3 topics from the model with top words\n",
    "topics = ldamodel.print_topics(num_words=4)\n",
    "for topic in topics:\n",
    "    print(topic)\n",
